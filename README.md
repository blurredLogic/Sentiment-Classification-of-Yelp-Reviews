# Sentiment-Classification-of-Yelp-Reviews
### Using machine learning, classify the sentiment behind a review on Yelp

To run this notebook, you will **require** the JSON file of reviews from the Yelp website. You can find the full dataset via this link: https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/open-dataset/

Instructions to run this:
1. Open the link provided above to get the tar file by clicking on the "Download JSON" button.
2. Open and extract the tar to a directory / folder.
3. Once extracted, you will see a pdf and a file. You will need to rename the file with a name but no extension and change the extension. Type in ".rar" after the name leaving no spaces.
6. Open and extract this new rar file to a folder / directory.
7. This will then result with a folder with 5 JSON files and a pdf. You only require the file with the name "yelp_academic_dataset_review.json".
8. Place this file in the same directory / folder as the notebook.
9. Open the notebook and everything should run with no issues.
